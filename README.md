# Emergency Menu

Emergency Menu is a C++ console application developed as a process inspection tool. It is designed to remain operational even when other similar tools fail by dynamically allocating memory addresses, ensuring reliable process inspection under challenging system conditions.

## Features

- Process inspection functionality with robust memory handling
- Dynamic allocation of memory addresses for enhanced reliability
- Console-based interface using MBCS (Multi-Byte Character Set)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release package from the official website:  
   [https://emergencymenu.vercel.app/](https://emergencymenu.vercel.app/)

2. Extract the ZIP archive to your preferred directory.

3. Run the executable file inside the extracted folder to launch the tool.

## Usage

Run the executable from a command prompt or terminal window. The console interface will guide you through the available options for inspecting processes.

Example:

```sh
EmergencyMenu.exe
```

Follow on-screen prompts to inspect running processes.

## Configuration

Configuration files and updates are downloaded directly from the website at runtime. There is no additional manual configuration required beyond extracting and running the executable.
